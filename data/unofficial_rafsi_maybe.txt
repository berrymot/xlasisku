bloblobloblo lujvo lamisotanis 1 (en)
$x_0$: word used to test the efficiency of a lujvo-building computer program. (nullary predicate)
-n
Also anything longer than four syllables of "blo" (rafsi of the gismu {bloti}). The test of building lujvo like these helps distinguish between lujvo building algorithms in polynomial time from those in exponential time, especially given that {bloti} has five rafsi. For example, the sozysozbot jvozba will take a significant amount of time to build the lujvo from eight {bloti}. See also: {bloti}.

Overrides the rule that sumti following a tanru with CO belong to the place structure of the right tanru unit. Scope of a single CO; "broda co brode co brodi" would need "co'ai" once to return to "brode" and twice to return to "broda". Proposed rafsi: -cox-. See also: {co}.

corci gismu krtisfranks 2 (en)
$x_1$ is a gesture/facial expression/body part motion/body language/expressive (nonverbal or nonvocal) feature/microexpression/stature/posture/sign/body signal [nonverbal expression made using only one's body parts and items on one's immediate person as extensions of the body in order to communicate; possibly nonlinguistic/extralinguistic] that conveys/expresses thought/emotion/command/idea $x_2$ (nu/si'o; possibly text and other types) made using body part/utensil/object/at locus $x_3$ in/by motion/action/means $x_4$
-n
Must be body-oriented; any other object involved is simply for the matter of convenience and acts as an extension of the body (and thus must be on the performer's immediate person at or near the locus of the gesture). Body language, posturing, and stature are usually considered to be nonlocalized (body-general), although they need not be (and technically are not in general). Must be externally visible and/or internally sensed. Any non-body-part utensil/item (including clothing) must function as an extension of the body in the gesture. Need not be conscious or performed by a person (note that agent/performer is not mentioned in this definition); can, but need not, be accompanied by vocalizations (not necessarily linguistic), but the gesture itself is not primarily noise-producing. Might include sign language words or cheremes, although a more explicit word for linguistically organized and “full” cheremes is preferred (and especially for the sign language as a whole). x1 is possibly best typed by {nu} and/or {si'o}. x4 might be best expressed as an event; for example, it could be "the event of the right hand touching the chest near the heart, with fist clenched" for a salute, whereas/wherein x3 would be merely the fist/hand (and the chest near the heart). Use "{cocygau}" resp. "{cocyzu'e}" for: "$x_1$ (agent resp. volitional entity) gestures; $x1$ agentively/actively makes gesture $x2$, communicating $x3$, performed with body part(s) $x4$ in motion $x5$"; this lujvo uses an unofficial cmarafsi. Proposed short rafsi: -coc-.

$x_{1}$ is a lock/seal of/on/for sealing $x_{2}$ with/by locking mechanism $x_{3}$.
-n
Equivalent to "{stela}"; gismu similarity conflict with "{stero}" prohibited *"stera". In a dialect which prefers this word over "stela", the rafsi for this word would be "-ter-" and the rafsi for "{te}" would be "-tel-", thus normalizing and uniformizing the rafsi of the primary members of selma'o SE. See also: "{ckiku}".
---
cunrafsi lujvo xabju 1 (en)
$r_1$ is an unpredictable/irregular affix for word/concept $r_2$, with form/properties $r_3$, in language $r_4$.
-n
In Lojban, cunrafsi are {rafsi} (bound combining forms) that derive unpredictably from {gismu} (root predicate-words). They are morphemes of the forms CCV, CVC, CVV, and CV'V (where C is a consonant, V is a vowel, and ' is the special sound /h/). Rafsi of these forms must be memorized alongside their source gismu, since they are assigned arbitrarily (within some constraints). By contrast, rafsi of the forms CCVC and CVCC are always predictable, and match up one-for-one with gismu; these may be called {jvarafsi} ('rule-rafsi'). Note also: cunrafsi are not 'irregular' in the sense of being assigned informally in a non-standard manner; they are a part of standard, official Lojban.

dinso gismu krtisfranks 2 (en)
$x_1$ is a 'dinosaur' [very general: any ancient quasi-reptilian vertebrate or, possibly but probably not, modern bird] of type $x_2$ living in era $x_3$.
-n
A gismu version of "{dinsauru}"; contrast with "{rexsa}" (in particular, this word probably would not but could refer to modern birds whereas "{rexsa}" can always do so without any connotation to the contrary; meanwhile, "{rexsa}" cannot refer to pterosaurs, ichthyosaurs, vel sim. but this word can). The use of this word is not strictly only relevant to members of clade Dinosauria, although it does include them (and, specifically, modern birds, although it connotes ancientness and extinction unless it is part of an explicitly contrary or general context); its referent might also/alternatively include pterosaurs, icthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, mosasaurs, dimetrodons, avemetatarsaliads, and perhaps even other ancient synapsids (in other words, any prehistoric quasi-reptilian vertebrate). As such, it is a qualitative word that bears no particular or strong attention or respect to genealogy, cladistics, taxology/taxonomy, or scientific/academic classification of these animals. Basically, any prehistoric animal the name of which ends in "-saur" can be so-described, as well as others. It probably should not reference more modern-like mammals proper. Proposed short rafsi: -dis-. See also: "{rexsa}", "{ketslau}", "{ikfiio}", "{disrmuzo}", "{plesiio}".

-n
Categorizer rafsi "dis" is meant (and experimentally proposed) to belong to the experimental gismu {dinso}; as such, it may not be the most elucidating; however, it is technically not essential to the interpretation of the lexeme. Technically, a extinct family of reptile order Squamata (which is extant), but {dinso} applies all the same (unlike {reksa}).

$x_1$ is clockwise/right-turn-direction of[/to] $x_2$ along/following track $x_3$ [path] in frame of reference $x_4$ (where the axis is within the region defined by the track as the boundary, as viewed from and defined by view(er) $x_4$; see notes); $x_1$ is locally to the right of $x_2$, according to $x_4$, constrained along $x_3$; $x_1$ is along a right turn from $x_2$ along path $x_3$, as viewed in frame $x_4$.
-n
Angular/curling direction: clockwise. he orientation of the path determines x4 but does not factor into consideration for x3. Further glosses: clockwise, locally rightward, right-turning (with no bulk translation) in a way that would be characterized as "negative" by the right-hand rule (aligned with and in the direction of a basis vector, at least for a given component). x1 is left-handedly/clockwise(ly) oriented relative to x2 on/along x3 in frame of reference x4.  x1 is left-handed (one sense) from x2 [more accurately: moving from x2 to x1 requires a(n imaginary) motion that is left-handed about/along x3 as seen in frame/orientation/perspective x4]. x1 is to the path-following right of x2 (where the path is connected; as such, x1 is also be to the path-following left of x2, although there is an implication that the former is the smaller (or equal-length) path). See also: {zucna}, {du'ei} (left-handed vectorial cross product), {du'oi} (modal). Proposed short rafsi: -tso-.

This is how a child feels on Christmas Eve night for Christmas Day. Usually positive; the negative version is essentially "dread". There should be a sense of longing (but future-oriented), intensity, and/or aching for what $x_1$ vaguely expects to happen (independent of what actually does end up happening).

For example, -badn- is the jvarafsi of {badna} 'banana', and can belong to no other word.

malglixlu lujvo spheniscine 2 (en)
$x_1=m_1=g_1=xl_3$ is an inappropriate anglicism made by $x_2=xl_2$, inappropriate according to $x_3=m_3$
-n
Refers to any kind of inappropriate reliance upon English in a Lojban (or non-English language) expression, but is most common for calques. Is sometimes even extended to cover reliance upon cultural assumptions. This lujvo is made to have more-specific rafsi-connotations than the historical lujvo-term "malglico" (under {malgli}), and to avoid possible clashing with the common lujvo construction of "malbroda" meaning "d**ned broda / broda in a bad way". The $xl_2$ place is also useful, allowing (mi se malglixlu) and (di'u malglixlu mi)

ma'oi cmavo ZO latros 4 (en)
selma'o quote; quotes a word (a cmavo) and uses it to name a selma'o.
-n
The output is the selma'o to which the quoted cmavo belongs (according to the relevant frammar/standards/version); thus any cmavo in the same given selma'o could be used in order to reference that selma'o (not just the canonical cmavo works). Example: "ma'oi coi" is equivalent to COI, as is "ma'oi co'o". For the most part, this will ignore sub-selma'o classes (such as VUhU1 versus VUhU2; both would be treated as simply VUhU). See also: "{ra'oi}".

$x_1$ is ornamentation which exhibits the property of being or being similar to millefiori, and which adorns $x_2$ and has composition/arrangement/pattern $x_3$
-n
This word uses experimental rafsi for experimental words: {xo'ei} ("-xon-"), {clenu}, {kukru}, {paxra}. $x_3$ also can detail the types of materials (glasses, metals, plastics, etc.) used and their colors. This is any ornamentation which is made by arranging rods or wires of aterial and fusing them together so that their axes are parallel, being fashioned so that a viewer observes a cross-section perpendicular to these axes (so that each rod can be partially seen). Perler bead art typically does this, for example.

mu'o'u cmavo MUhOhU krtisfranks 1 (en)
Marks an endpoint of a quote/string/expression and specifies that (relative to the original) the quote/string/expression so marked is complete, accurate, and well-portrayed by the quote/string/expression on the relevant side of the excerpt, including wrt all relevant information and when factoring in the content and context of the quotation-external discourse in which said quote/string/expression appears.
-n
Must be adjacent to a quotation marker (including terminator or delimiter) or "{sedu'u}" or similar; it attaches to the/such a marker such that it is external to the scope of the quote/expression produced/contained/terminated by that marker. For example, in "lu mu'o'u lu coi li'u li'u mu'o'u", the first instance of this word attaches to the second "{lu}" (because it is inside the quotation produced by the first "lu") and the second instance of this word attaches to the second instance of "{li'u}"; it cannot appear adjacent to "{coi}" in this example and yet function in application to the expressed quotation markers because it would then be inside all of the available quotations (nested, in this case), although such is allowed as a pure string (because being able to quote an expression such as "He did say "mu'o'u"" is utile). In a quotation (such as a "lu"-"li'u" quotation) with two markers (initiation and termination), even if one of them is implicit: if this word appears before the quote (at its initiation), then it means that there is no relevant and material information preceding the original version of the presented quote which would drastically alter its interpretation (for example: if the original is "not big", then "big" is technically a quote/substring thereof but there is information prior to this substring which materially alters the interpretation, namely "not"; likewise, cutting out the subject of a sentence which is being quoted and then using the quote in a context in which the subject is implied to be someone or something other than the original constitutes a material change in meaning due to incompleteness and this word would specify against that); if the word appears after the quote (at its termination), then it means that there is no relevant and material information following the original version of the presented quote which would drastically alter its interpretation (for example: if the original is "he chose the men and the women" but the presented quote/substring is "he chose the men" (in a context such that sexism is being accused), then there is information following the presented quote/substring which alters the interpretation, namely "and the women"); note that the interpretation-altering information need not immediately precede or follow the presented quote. For singly-marked quotes (such as by "{zo}") it means that the presented quote/string/expression is complete on both ends (including being the complete word / all relevant rafsi in a lujvo). Modifying this word with "-{nai}" indicates that there definitely is a material change in the meaning of the quote due in part to completeness or lack of appropriate context (textual or otherwise). See also: "{rau'o}", "{rau'oi}", "{boi'o'u}" (for a solution to a technical catch with this word).

nei'ai cmavo NEIhAI krtisfranks 1 (en)
double-negative toggle: every odd-counted explicit usage makes negation additive; unmentioned or every even-counted explicit usage makes negation multiplicative.
-n
It applies to the entirety of the current bridi and all future ones until toggled again; multiple but separated usages of this word within the same bridi behave as if they were adjacent. "Additive negation" means that multiple negatives just intensify, but do not cancel, one another. For example in English: "I ain't seen nothin'" means that the speaker is very emphatically claiming to have seen nothing of interest. This is the standard operation for negation in Spanish. "Multiplicative negation" means that negatives cancel, but do not intensify, one another (possibly taking a neutral or abstentional state). "I did not see nothing" in this mode means that the speaker did indeed see something. Note that multiplicative double-negatives are not necessarily equivalent to affirmatives in general. "I like cheese" is an affirmative statement and is not equivalent to "I do not dislike cheese", which is a multiplicative double-negative (and which may indicate a reluctant acceptance of cheese or a neutral feeling toward cheese). In this mode, an even number of negatives in a given statement is not negative and an odd number of negatives in a given statement is not positive. This word applies to all negatives in the text, whether they are free words or rafsi. This word also, but less dramatically, applies to affirmations: in additive mode, multiple affirmatives intensify one another ("I am indeed very much so going!" is a strongly emphasized positive statement); in multiplicative mode, they simply reduce to a single affirmation (for like example, "I am going"). This means that care must be taken: In additive mode, an affirmative marker will partially cancel with a negative particle in some way, reducing its intensity and possibly bringing it to a neutral statement ("I am indeed - not - going" is a neutral statement in this mode, similar to "I may be going"; English does not really have the ability to express such things); in multiplicative mode, an affirmative coupled with a negative simply reduces to the negative, possibly strengthened by a factor equivalent to the intensity of the affirmer ("I am indeed not going" is a clear way of saying that the speaker will not go).

nicfa gismu krtisfranks 1 (en)
$x_1$ (vector) is the displacement of $x_2$ (object/point) relative to $x_3$ (object/point; contextless default: origin) in coordinate system/frame of reference/as measured by $x_4$ according to definition/standard/(meta)physics $x_5$
-n
x1 is (four-)vector-valued; it is a function that maps to a tensor (probably a vector or scalar) to a (four-)vector. Units are handled in x1, which will be a (four-)vector of {mitre} or the like. Time of measurement is just «ca» or the argument of the function(s) in x1, or can be defined instantaneously by x4. Proposed short rafsi: -nif-. See also: {nifkemtemsalri}.

nifkemtemsalri lujvo krtisfranks 1 (en)
$x_1$ (vector) is the differintegral (with respect to time) of order $x_2$ of the displacement of $x_3$ (object/point) relative to $x_4$ (object/point/frame of reference; contextless default: the origin in the home frame) in coordinate system/frame of reference/as measured by $x_5$ according to definition/standard/(meta)physics $x_6$, taken with starting point $x_7$
-n
This word uses two experimental gismu (one with an experimental rafsi): {nicfa} and {salri}. If x2 is negative, then x1 is a time-derivative (velocity, acceleration, jerk, etc. (for whole number values)); if it is positive, then x1 is a time-integral (moments); if it is 0, then x1 is displacement itself. The first and last options are the most common. All differintegrals are based on displacement, rather than one of its differintegrals. x1 is vector-valued.

This word is useful for ownership of a movie, or a rented house, or a do at work/school, among other things; one does not really own theset things, only the right to use them. One may or may not have the object in one's physical or immediate possession; the concept of what constitutes "having in one's physical possession" is left semantically ambiguous. Permanence of this status or authority over it is not specified. This word uses the experimental rafsi "-pov-" for the word {po'o}.

$x_1$ is a rodent [can be a member of eutherian mammal Rodentia; semantic broadening might subjectively generalize the concept somewhat] of subtaxon/type/genus/species/breed/variety $x_2$.
-n
A {zevla} form of "{ronte}" which retains its general sound and approximate word/string length and which has similar possibilities for rafsi. This word is intended to replace "ronte" if the Lojban community decides to favor "{ronti}" over "ronte" when resolving the conflict. This word is a near-{gismu} {cmazve} version of: "{ratcnrodentia}", "{rontnrodentia}". Meant for any rodent in general (more general than "{ratcu}", "{smacu}"). Semantic broadening may allow for any 'small, scurrying mammal' to be so named (such as lagomorphs; such description should be avoided in technical contexts and is not necessarily disparaging (unlike in English)). For the subjective generalization of concept to any 'small scurrying mammal' made explicit, unambiguous, and clear, use: "{rauntysmimabru}".

selkicrypoi lujvo krtisfranks 1 (en)
$x_1$ is an ordered series of podcast episodes/podcast serial, ordered by conparison rule $x_2$ (contextless default: production order or intended listening order, or reverse of these), and being entirely composed of all of the individual episodes belonging to set $x_3$.
-n
Technically, any sequence of any podcast episodes is such a thing. Moreover, some podcasts are just a collection of episodes which have no intended listening order (if old episodes are meant to be listened to at all). However, this word is meant to encompass only canonical serial productions of closely related episodes in a certain listening order. Thus, a playlist on shuffle breaks the spirit/intent of this term but not its technical definition; every episode in a certian program, though, satisfies the intention (especially if $x_2$ is a reasonable listening order thereof) - although complications arise if there is no reasonable listening order to be endowed upon the set of episodes. This word uses a rafsi of an experimental gismu: {kicra}.

$x_1$ is familiar to the memories of $x_2$ in feature $x_3$ (ka) and by standard $x_4$; $x_2$ knows/is familiar with/has lived memory of $x_2$.
-n
For example: A person may know/have known/remember their grandparents, even if the latter are dead. The general emphasis is that the familiarity was gained in and might be applicable to only/primarily the past, or might strictly belong to the past/memory. Considering that events end and people change or die, it is hard to say that something which belongs strictly to the past or which may have evolved beyond recognition in some respects remains presently 'familiar' ({slabu}), even if it was experienced formerly. This word uses the proposed/experimental rafsi '-ve'i-' of the experimental gismu "{vedli}"; it also relies on "slabu" taking a greater connotation of familiarity/'knowledge' (in the Spanish "conocer" sense) due to the introduction of the experimental gismu "{laldo}" for other meanings of "old".

$x_1$ is $\sqrt{A} = \sqrt{2*5}$ [decimal: $1\times10^{+(1/2)}$] of $x_2$ in dimension/aspect $x_3$ (default is units).
-n
This works as all other Metric prefixes do. In decimal, $10^{(1/2)}=\sqrt{(10)}=3.16227766\dots$ (also expressed/represented in decimal). In different bases, this value may change; for example, in hexadecimal, it might be exactly four ($4$); however, this is an outstanding as-of-yet unsolidified area in the Lojban grammar/semantics (do "{ki'o}" and Metric prefixes change according to the base?). This number is nice, as it is close to both 3 and and the circle constant pi ($\pi$) in decimal usage; these three values arise fairly frequently and a great trick in decimal Fermi estimation is to use their approximate identity in order to simplify expressions. Now, when the quantity is dimensionful (has units), if the mantissa approximates this value, then one can instead express the mantissa as approximately 1 and the unit as being augmented by this prefix. This word is also good for short-hand/quick expressions. This word has no English equivalent and is not part of the official set of SI prefixes, but it does generalize them. "{xaudbo}" = "{kamre} {li} {dau} {te'a} {fi'u} {re}" in decimal (if it generalizes for other bases, change "dau" into the base; in other words, "dau" generally becomes "pano" in such case, where the base is given by context). While this suggestion is not perfectly compatible with SI (which allows only one prefix at a time), the negative-power version of this ("kamre li dau te'a {ni'u} fi'u re", where "dau" has the aforementioned caveats; $1\times10^{-(1/2)}$) can just be expressed as a lujvo/rafsi/tanru containing both "{decti}" and this word (as veljvo/selrafsi/{seljavytertau}), because $A^{(-1/2)}=\sqrt{(1/A)}=A^{(+1/2)}/A$, and $A$ (ten in at least decimal) is the base. A "{xaudbydectre}" is a single unit which (in decimal) happens to approximate an imperial/U.S. customary foot (unit).

xo'ei cmavo VUhU krtisfranks 3 (en)
unary mekso operator: produces a string of n consecutive "xo'e"'s, treated as digits (concatenated into a single string of digits)
-n
n can be any nonnegative integer, (countable) infinity, or vague (in which case it could mean a nonnegative integer or (countable) infinity). The default value of n is vague/elliptical, thus transforming this word into a 0-ary operator. The output is a string of digits, not a number; thus, it automatically attaches to a string of PA's if immediately preceding this word; following digits must be concatenated on; it might be necessary to convert this string into a number (especially if it is isolated and/or is being acted upon an operator that is defined as desired for numbers but not for digits or strings), but the conversion may be automatic according to the grammar (at least in some contexts). {xo'e} is considered to represent exactly one 'digit' (really: PA member) in the given base until it is converted into a number. Since {pi} belongs to PA, technically at least zero {xo'e}'s can actually be meant to be radix point(s); at most, the total allowable number of radix points in a digit string, less the number of explicitly mentioned {pi}'s that occur therein (within the macrodigit), is the number of {pi}'s that can be referenced elliptically by this means. {ma'u} and {ni'u} are possible references for microdigits where allowed by the base.  This word 'knows where it lives', meaning that it will only produce digit strings that are composed of PA's that are allowed by the base and notation given the rest of the context, which form allowed macrodigits, and which will represent part of a context-allowed number. Proposed rafsi: "-xon-", where the default case (n is vague) is assumed (thus, as a rafsi, "-xon-" represents any number that is expressible in the base by a string of concatenated digits and radix point(s) and which makes sense/satisfies implicit conditions placed upon it (such as signum, or being integer, etc.); this meaning is usually described by using variables "n" or "x" in English, such as in: "n-ary", "n-many", "x-meter-long", etc.).

xoi'ei'a cmavo XOIhEIhA krtisfranks 1 (en)
Toggles grammar so that every mention of a number $n$ is interpreted as "at least $n$".
-n
If one owns five cats, then in normal Lojban grammar, if they were to say "I have two cats", then they would be incorrect/lying; numbers are exact. But often, allowing for such statements is desirable, at least because one can be less mindful of the exactitude requirement. For example, some criminal statutes say things like "if the defendant has four criminal history points, then...", but they actually mean "if the defendant has four or more criminal history points, then...". Likewise, it is almost always a lie in Lojban to say "I am $t$ years old", because one is almost never exactly $t$ years old (this expression is usually the result of rounding down to the nearest integer or half-integer); one should actually say "I am between $t$ years old and $t+1$ years old" – but toggling the grammar with this word would more closely approximate the natlang phrase (although an eighty-year-old could still correctly say, perhaps with some philosophical correctness too, that they are six years old). An even number of uses of this word return the grammar back to numeric exactitude. The "at least" interpretation applies to rafsi as well: a car is a bicycle after this word has been used an odd number of times because "bicycle" would actually mean "at-least-two-wheeler". Again, this could have some applicability in law, such as when banning the usage of vehicles, for example. "{su'e} will operate normally under this word (so, "su'e {re}" would mean "at most 2" and not "at most at-least-2"; meaning that 3 is definitely excluded from the realm of possible numbers), but "su'o" is converted so as to mean "exactly" (given that it is otherwise useless; in other words, the exactitudes of unmarked numhers and "su'o"-marked ones swap with one another). This word does not affect brivla or modals, unless the former involve numeric rafsi; in particular, "{zmadu}", "{satci}", "{mau}", and the like are not affected. This word affects non-integer numbers as well, as demonstrated by the time example; after this toggle, one could accurately say that Cleopatra died five hundred years ago (because she died ealier than that). Explocit approximation via "{ji'i}" is unaffected by this word, in a manner similar to "su'e". Technically, "1+1 =2" is still true under this toggle effect because the sum of at least 1 with at least 1 is indeed at least 2. Both exactitude and this modification to it have their respective problem cases, so use each carefully.

begin quote that is converted into rafsi
-n
Terminated by {zei'oi}. Quotes an utterance (must be grammatical) and converts it (as a whole) into a single rafsi with the meaning of "something to do with the referent of "[insert quoted text]"". Notably, does not distribute through the text, treating each word individually with left-grouping (it does not distribute {zei} before and/or after each word (as needed)); the quoted utterance is taken as a whole unit of meaning unto itself; for the former purpose, see {zei'ei'au}. This word is useful for forming quotes and mathematical expressions (formal, evaluated, or otherwise) into lujvo. This rafsi is assumed to begin the next word if the preceding text/utterance does not end with an otherwise standalone and ungrammatical rafsi (the grammar in such a situation should be discussed); in order to connect it as a rafsi within a lujvo that began before it, precede the quotation with {zei}. In order to finish a lujvo or treat the quotation as a brivla on its own, follow it with {co'e}, which is treated as if the preceding utterance (the quote) is a single word followed immediately by {zei}; in order to string multiple ZEIhEI-ZEIhOI rafsi together follow this formula: zei'ei broda zei'oi co'e zei zei'ei brode zei'oi (co'e (zei...))... . Individual rafsi outside of lujvo are typically not grammatical (except in certain quotation structures, vel sim.).

zei'ei'au cmavo ZEIhEI krtisfranks 1 (en)
begin quote that is converted into rafsi, distributing lujvo-glue between quoted words
-n
Terminated by {zei'oi}. Begins a quote of a grammatical utterance. Between each word in the utterance, {zei} is to be interpreted and any grouping that might be applied is left-grouping. In other words, {zei} is distributed left-groupingly between each word; each word is treated on its own, individually; the quote is not treated as a whole. The final word is interpreted to have {zei} after it as well (this is a quirk of {zei'oi}), thus the quote is a string of rafsi, left-groupingly considered to be a rafsi. In order to end the lujvo formed with such a quote, follow it by {co'e}. This word compactifies large {zei}-clauses/-statements. For the perhaps generally more useful, if slightly more ambiguous, quote marker that treats the quote as a whole entity and converts it singly and wholly into a rafsi (rather than a rafsi string, as is done by this word), see: {zei'ei}. This word works as {zei'ei} does in all other regards (including as a marker for a new word (specifically a lujvo) unless preceded by {zei} or possibly by a standalone and otherwise ungrammatical rafsi). For the purpose of quoting with {ra'oi}, the result of a {zei'ei'au}-quote is treated as a single rafsi.

-n
Use SE in order to reorder the sumti slots. Typically, the word in question should be a non-cmavo brivla, but this is not always the case. When used as a rafsi, it modifies the last veljvo and deletes all except the first $n$ (subscripted) sumti slots (regardless of any inferred relations between them and the sumti slots of other companion veljvo,  or of any implied filling (unless such is actually explicit), which otherwise would or could exist); in rafsi form, the subscript is implied to be 1 (meaning that all except the first unfilled sumti slot is deleted) unless explicitly specified otherwise, else veljvo structure no longer makes much sense; the subscript marker "{xi}" (proposed rafsi: "-xix-") is required for explicit specification of the subscript unless there is a veljvo bracket or tanru-grouping modifier (such as  "{ke'e}") which makes such interpretation the only possible option from a syntactic, semantic, AND practical standpoint. Proposed rafsi: "-zes-" (because the last letteral for it should be able to cluster tightly with "-xix-").

Angular/curling direction: counterclockwise. The orientation of the path determines x4 but does not factor into consideration for x3.

In particular, he recognizes that “-zu’a-” might be confusing as a rafsi for this word while being a modal cmavo for {zunle}; but he does believe that this word deserves a vowel-final short rafsi.)
